# Introduction 
This is an elementary python control package for aerotech stages.

Notice that I have modified the code from repo https://github.com/robmarkcole/aerotech.git.
I guess the core of this package is the same as that in that repo.

I tried to fork that repo. However, somehow I failed. Perhaps the github
has just changed the function? I am not sure.

# Notice
I do not guarantee that the package will work for your situation.
Please test it thoroughly if you would like to use it for your 
own project.
